# Hypothesis_Testing_Insurance_Data
 

## Introduction 

Data scientists use hypothesis testing to determine if outcomes are meaningful or just due to chance. We use the term "statistical significance" (or "calculated probability", p-value) to indicate we have done a statistical test to mathematically determine whether our results are random.  A p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference/value could have occurred just by random chance.  The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.  After the p-value is calculated, it is compared to the alpha level (typically = .05) to identify the appropriate parametric or non-parametric tool for evaluating the validity of our assumed belief/suspicion (hypothesis).

## Problem Description

This project uses Kaqgle's [US Health Insurance Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBN8DPW2rdiRrY34eEM53HAzakNGSRrw4ogI-j8HyCUrbqTB_z4CeIn2IvjLF-w_6sOe5pIlypJGAA/pub?output=csv) to exercise your hypothesis testing skills and help you answer the following questions:

- Q1. Do smokers have higher insurance charges than non-smokers?

- Q2. Are men more likely to smoke than women?

- Q3. Do different regions have different charges, on average?


## Solution Description
For each question, make sure to:

- State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis

- Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples

- Test the assumptions of your selected test

- Execute the selected test, or the alternative test (if you do not meet the assumptions)

- Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis

- Show at least one supporting visualization that helps display the result
